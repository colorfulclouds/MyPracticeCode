I think most people like traveling because they can feel the beauty of the nature and breathe the 
fresh air at the same time.What's more they can make friends.But there are some disadvantages of travelling,
such as,the weather may change quickly and you may be wet in the rain.So my suggestion is that before you travel,
you should listen to the weather report and get to know about the weather and you'd better travel with others 
so that you are not into my all.1228794458
